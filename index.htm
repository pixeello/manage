  <h1>You Don’t Have Much Time</h1>
  <p>Every day you delay is a day you never get back.<br>
  Time is not waiting for you. It's slipping by — hour by hour, day by day — whether you're focused or distracted.</p>

  <div class="highlight">Look at where you are now. Are you where you want to be?<br><strong>If not, what are you doing still waiting?</strong></div>

  <p>No one’s coming to rescue you. No perfect moment is going to appear.<br>
  The only moment you <strong>own</strong> is this one — <strong>right now</strong>.</p>

  <p>You have goals for a reason. You feel restless for a reason.  
  That pressure inside you? That’s your potential screaming to be realized.</p>

  <p><strong>Don’t wait for motivation. Build discipline.</strong><br>
  Stop thinking. Start moving.<br>
  There’s no shortcut, but there <strong>is</strong> a clear path: <strong>Do the work. Every day. No matter what.</strong></p>

  <p>Because if you don’t, you’ll wake up one day wishing you started today.</p>

  <div class="highlight"><strong>You don’t have time to waste.</strong></div>
